# Multi-Domain Automation

## The Challenge: 
- Traditionally, networks contains distinct domains
- A single domain alone canâ€™t serve the business needs of your entire enterprise.


## The Solution: 
 - Cisco multidomain integrations help ensure that all individual networking domains work together to help you achieve your digital transformation objectives
- Leveraging Cisco's open APIs and Cisco Action Orchestrator we can consistently automate configuration and deployment of your Network Infrastructure and Data Center


## The Story:
 - Big retail chain standing up a new store
 - Connection to data center for price list is necessary
 - Quickly deploy local network at the branch
 - Local compute is required. Grant local compute correct access to data center services
